# If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT
### A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLMWorld

Repository for the paper ["If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01617), by Adrian de Wynter.

Loneliness is a serious problem. It has been called an epidemic by the US Surgeon General, and the WHO considers it a public health concern. Regardless of what you call it, it is a serious problem:
- It could lead to very serious mental and physical health problems, like cardiovascular disease, depression, and an overall mortality rate.
- It is on the rise, with younger generations self-reporting loneliness often. 
- There's a lot of stigma associated with it, so not a lot of people talk about it or seek help.

The purpose of the paper is to study the impact of ChatGPT (and by extension other LLM-powered services) on lonely users. 
By parsing WildChat, we find that this is impact is not very clear-cut: although ChatGPT appears to be somewhat effective at mitigating loneliness in some, it risks (and appears to) exacerbating it in others. There's also very noticeable toxicity increases in lonely dialogues when compared to the general corpus, with women and minors being significantly more targeted than men.

All in all, it is clear that everyone (but in our paper, the scientific community and tech companies) need to get better at addressing this problem. For one, this code is released under a permissive licence (I don't own the data, so not that one) to improve research on loneliness. Please feel free to contact me as well--we should all work together to solve this!
